# Domain and Range of Multi-variable Functions

## Function 1: $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 2$

### Domain
The function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 2$ involves square terms of $x$ and $y$, which are defined for all real numbers. Therefore, the domain of $f$ is all ordered pairs of real numbers:
\[ \text{Domain} = \mathbb{R}^2 \]

### Range
Since $x^2$ and $y^2$ are both non-negative, the smallest value of $x^2 + y^2$ is 0 (occurring when both $x$ and $y$ are 0). Thus, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 2. There is no upper limit to the values of $x^2 + y^2$, so:
\[ \text{Range} = [2, \infty) \]

## Function 2: $f(x, y) = x + 2y$

### Domain
The function $f(x, y) = x + 2y$ is a linear function of $x$ and $y$, and there are no restrictions on the values of $x$ and $y$. Hence:
\[ \text{Domain} = \mathbb{R}^2 \]

### Range
As a linear function, $f(x, y)$ can take any real number depending on the values of $x$ and $y$. Therefore, 
\[ \text{Range} = \mathbb{R} \]

## Function 3: $f(x, y) = \frac{1}{x + 2y}$

### Domain
The function $f(x, y) = \frac{1}{x + 2y}$ is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the domain excludes points where \( x + 2y = 0 \). Solving for \( y \) gives \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), which is a line in the xy-plane. Thus, the domain of $f$ is:
\[ \text{Domain} = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(x, y) \mid y = -\frac{x}{2}\} \]

### Range
Since $f(x, y)$ can approach any non-zero real number as \( x + 2y \) approaches any non-zero value, and it can approach both positive and negative infinity depending on whether \( x + 2y \) approaches zero from positive or negative directions respectively, the range of \( f \) is all real numbers except for zero:
\[ \text{Range} = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \]

# Conclusion

We have analyzed the domain and range for three multi-variable functions:

1. $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 2$ with domain $\mathbb{R}^2$ and range $[2, \infty)$.

2. $f(x, y) = x + 2y$ with domain and range both being $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}$ respectively.

3. $f(x, y) = \frac{1}{x + 2y}$ with domain $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(x, y) \mid y = -\frac{x}{2}\}$ and range $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$.
